linux distro
============

Use LFS and BLFS (Linux From Scratch and Beyond LFS) to create an effecient, simple and functional linux distribution.

- use linux kernel as base. Try other alternatives later (LIQUORIX,FREEBSD-kernel,HURD,L4)
- use MATE as UI
- Maybe wayland?
- use GTK3 and nice themes
- use sinking titanic as project logo
- use error messages like: "ship going down"
- use "my heart will go on" by celine dion, as start-up sound
- rename (symlinks!) core unix programs. ex.: sudo->captain
